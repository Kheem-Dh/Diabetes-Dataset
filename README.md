# Diabetes-Dataset

# Objectives 
### You need to complete two parts of the assignment and submit all materials as one zip file (include all code and report). 
#### 1. Write the code for the tasks given below. The code must be clear and well commented. 
#### 2. You need to write a technical report about the analysis of your results obtained for each question with some visualizations where required. This can be in pdf or word format. 

### In all questions, use of 80% samples for training and 20% for testing is recommended.

## Question 1. 
### a) Find covariance of the features and plot them. Write your analysis about the correlation and explain which features are highly correlated. 
### Hint: for plotting you can use seaborn library 
### b) For this question, consider “Blood Pressure” as dependent variable and Age as independent variable. Fit a linear regression model to predict “Blood Pressure” from Age. Repeat the experiment for 20 epochs and calculate mean square error for each iteration. Finally, plot the error against each iteration.
### c) Repeat the experiment this time with Exponential loss instead of squared error. Write detailed technical and logical comments on the difference/similarities in the two experiments.


### Note: For each sub-section in Question 2, find the confusion matrix and derive metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure. 

## Question 2. 
### a) Apply logistic regression on all features on the provided dataset. You must use Batch Gradient Descent to calculate the optimal values of the model parameters. 
### b) Repeat above experiment and this time use stochastic gradient descent. Write detailed technical and logical comments on the difference/similarities in the two experiments. 
### c) Repeat above experiment with k-fold cross-validation for training and finding the optimal values of the model parameters. Write detailed technical and logical comments about its performance. 
### d) Repeat the experiment with 10 number of epochs and use 10% of the data for training and 90% for testing. Show the results in a write your comments about the obtained results.
